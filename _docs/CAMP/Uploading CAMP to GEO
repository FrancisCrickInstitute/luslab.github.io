# GEO submission

## Step 1. Create your personalised upload space at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/info/submissionftp.html

You will then be allocated a personalised directory for your GEO workspace e.g. `uploads/ojziff_MLcHSUY2`

## Step 2: Create a folder on CAMP containing all files for GEO upload:

1. fastq files - ensure these are compressed
2. processed data (e.g. differential gene expression results csv file)
3. metadata csv file

Check folder size `du -hs geo_submission_oct20/`  # 159G

## Step 3. Transfer files to your personalised upload space according to FTP upload instructions

Two options for transfer are with ncftpput or ncftp:

1. ‘ncftpput’ (transfers from the command-line without entering an interactive shell)
```bash
ml ncftp
sbatch -N 1 -c 8 --mem=0 -t 48:00:00 --wrap=“ncftpput -F -R -z -u  geoftp  -p “rebUzyi1"  ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov  ./uploads/ojziff_MLcHSUY2  /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/astrocyte-meta-analysis/reads/geo_submission_oct20" --job-name=ncftpput
```

2. ‘ncftp’ requires an interactive shell
```bash
ml ncftp
ncftp
set passive on
set so-bufsize 33554432
open  ftp://geoftp:rebUzyi1@ftp-private.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
cd uploads/ojziff_MLcHSUY2
put -R /camp/home/ziffo/home/projects/astrocyte-meta-analysis/reads/geo_submission_oct20
```

## Step 4. After the FTP transfer is complete, notify GEO using the  [Submit to GEO](https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/submission/)  web form

NB if you fail to notify them then the files will be automatically deleted from the server after two weeks. Once notified, they move the files to a safe location for review.
