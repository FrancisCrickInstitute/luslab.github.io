# What is Nextflow?

**Nextflow** is a language for pipeline development that became a standard in our lab.

We use Nextflow for:

 - Developing pipelines to process a particular type (or types) of data (for example, various CLIP datasets);
 - Make our computational projects reproducible.

If you need a pipeline to process a particular type of data, please check [pipelines from the nf-core project](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) first. This is an international collaboration aimed at development of gold-standard Nextflow pipelines for processing of different types of bioinformatical and similar data. You can read more about nf-core initiative [here](https://nf-co.re/).

If there is no pipeline for your data in the nf-core collection, or you are setting up your own project, then you will need to right some Nextflow code!

# Quickstart 

About the Nextflow course.

In Nextflow, a pipeline is organised into **processes** (blocks of code that define data processing steps) and **channels** (objects that connect processes and carry data from one process to another).
