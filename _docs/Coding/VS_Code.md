[Visual Studio Code (or VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source text editor released by Microsoft and 
[becoming increasingly popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) among software developers. 
Thanks to a huge number of handy extensions, VS Code is a great option for anything, from Python scripts 
to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#format) 
to tables in CSV/TSV format. Also, VS Code is tightly integrated with [Git](../../reproducibility/git.md) and allows a developer to use multiple 
command line terminals. If you would like to try VS Code (which we really recommend!), then please read further.

**Note.** For R we recommend using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), for data analysis in Python - [Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/), 
for a big software development project in Python [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) may be the best environment; 
finally, for coding in Java [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a standard _de facto_. 

1. Install VS Code from [its official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Checkout the Interactive Playground from the Welcome page to learn some useful ways of efficient code editing in VS Code.
