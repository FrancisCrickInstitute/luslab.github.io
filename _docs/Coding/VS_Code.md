[Visual Studio Code (or VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source text editor released by Microsoft and 
[becoming increasingly popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#development-environments-and-tools) among software developers. 
Thanks to a huge number of handy extensions, VS Code is a great option for anything, from Python scripts 
to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to [Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#format) 
to tables in CSV/TSV format. Also, VS Code is tightly integrated with [Git](../../reproducibility/git.md) and allows a developer to use multiple 
command line terminals. If you would like to try VS Code (which we really recommend!), then please read further.

**Note.** For R we recommend using [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/), for data analysis in Python - [Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/), 
for a big software development project in Python [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) may be the best environment; 
finally, for coding in Java [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a standard _de facto_. 

To begin to use VS Code:

1. Install VS Code from [its official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. Checkout the Interactive Playground from the Welcome page to learn some useful ways of efficient code editing in VS Code.

3. Choose a color theme you like using the Color theme section of the Welcome page.

4. If you are moving to VS Code from another text editor, you may want to use familiar keybindings. If so, check out the Settings and keybindings section of the Welcome page. If you want to use native VS Code keybindings, please check out its cheatsheet, available from the Welcome page as a PDF (see Help, Printable keyboard cheatsheet). You can also easily add your own keybindings (see below).

5. You may want to install the following useful extensions to benefit from the start:

- [Nextflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nextflow.nextflow) (Nextflow syntax support)

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) (Python syntax support)

- [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts) (Markdown support)

- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) (Markdown style checking)

- [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) (Dockerfile syntax support and more)

- [Gitconfig Syntax](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sidneys1.gitconfig) (Syntax support for git config files)

- [gitignore](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codezombiech.gitignore) (Syntax support for .gitignore)

- [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) (Support for coding on a remote machine)

- [Edit csv](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=janisdd.vscode-edit-csv) (Edit CSV files as an Excel-style spreadsheet)

- [WordCounter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kirozen.wordcounter) (Count words as you write; it is useful when writing abstracts)

6. Shortcuts for the terminal - find and outline (a new terminal beside the code; create a new terminal; move between terminals and code)

7. You can work with Git straight from VS Code. Please see [VS Code documentation about using Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol). Of course, instead, you can still use Git from the command line or a dedicated graphical software like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). For details, please see our pages about [Git](../../reproducibility/git.md) and [GitHub](../../reproducibility/luslab-github.md).

You are now well equipped to use VS Code! Happy coding!
