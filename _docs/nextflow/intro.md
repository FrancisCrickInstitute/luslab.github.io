**Nextflow** is a language for pipeline development that became a standard in our lab.

We use Nextflow for:

 - Developing pipelines to process a particular type (or types) of data (for example, various CLIP datasets).
 - Make our computational projects reproducible.

If you need a pipeline to process a particular type of data, please check [our nf-core wiki page](../nf-core) first. 

If there is no pipeline for your data in the nf-core collection, or you are setting up your own project (and hence need to organise your data processing in a reproducible way), then you will need to right some Nextflow code! 

**Please make sure you use the DSL2 syntax when conding in Nextflow!**

See [our wiki page on how to run Nextflow on CAMP](../../CAMP/running_nextflow.md).

Please check out the following resources to get up and running with Nextflow: 

 1. [Nextflow overall documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)
 2. [Nextflow DSL2 documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html)
 3. [Nextflow coding patterns](https://nextflow-io.github.io/patterns/index.html)
