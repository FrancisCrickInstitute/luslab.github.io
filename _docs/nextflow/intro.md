# What is Nextflow?

**Nextflow** is a language for pipeline development that became a standard in our lab.

We use Nextflow for:

 - Developing pipelines to process a particular type (or types) of data (for example, various CLIP datasets).
 - Make our computational projects reproducible.

If you need a pipeline to process a particular type of data, please check [pipelines from the nf-core project](https://nf-co.re/pipelines) first. 
This is an international collaboration aimed at development of gold-standard Nextflow pipelines for processing of different types of bioinformatical 
and similar data. You can read more about nf-core initiative on the [nf-core page of our wiki](https://github.com/luslab/luslab.github.io/blob/master/_docs/nextflow/nf-core.md) and [on their official website](https://nf-co.re/).

If there is no pipeline for your data in the nf-core collection, or you are setting up your own project, then you will need to right some Nextflow code! 

**Please make sure you use the DSL2 syntax when conding in Nextflow!**

See [this wiki page](...) on how to run Nextflow on CAMP.
