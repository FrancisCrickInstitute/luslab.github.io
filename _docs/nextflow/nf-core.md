# What is nf-core?

**nf-core** is an international initiative aimed at development of gold-standard Nextflow pipelines to process different types of bioinformatical 
and other data. 

If you need to process a specific kind of bioinformatical data or do a particular kind of analysis, please check the [available nf-core pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines). Please, also check out the following resources to get up and running with nf-core:

1. [nf-core: The official website](https://nf-co.re)
2. [nf-core: Available pipelines](https://nf-co.re/pipelines)
3. [nf-core: Getting started](https://nf-co.re/usage/introduction)
4. [nf-core: Tutorial](https://nf-co.re/usage/nf_core_tutorial)

You can get help and learn the latest news about nf-core in the `nf-core` Slack workspace (you can join it [here](https://nf-co.re/join)). Make sure you join the channel dedicated to a pipeline that you are going to use (for example, `chipseq` or `atacseq`). Channels `help` and `training` can also be very useful!

Apart from ready-to-use pipelines, nf-core has a growing collection of modules - wrapped bioinformatical tools ready to import into an nf-core pipeline. As of August, 2020, this collection is still under construction, but should get more stable in the near future. Here you can find the [repository of the nf-core modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules). 

If you are thinking about developing a new pipeline for a particular data type that could be incorporated into nf-core in the future, please make sure to join the `new-pipelines` channel in the nf-core Slack workspace and ask there if it is a good idea (someone may be planning to do the same kind of a pipeline, or an existing pipeline may cover the functionality that you want to implement).
